# Unofficial GameNative 0.7.2 - Release Summary

This release introduces direct integration with the community repository for drivers and components, alongside critical fixes for navigation and custom game art.

## NEW: REPOSITORY INTEGRATION
- **Contents Manager:** Now directly connects to the `maxjivi05/Components` repository. You can download and install the latest versions of DXVK, VKD3D, Box64, WOWBox64, and FEXCore with one tap.
- **Driver Manager:** Added a "GN" (Official) and "MTR" (Community) toggle. Switching to MTR gives you access to a dynamic list of community-contributed drivers fetched directly from GitHub.
- **Smart Sorting:** MTR drivers are now automatically organized by version. The latest releases (e.g., v1.8.5) are always displayed at the top of the list for easy access.
- **Dynamic Updates:** The app pulls the latest component lists fresh from the repository every time you open the managers.

## CUSTOM GAMES & ART
- **Robust Icon Extraction:** New engine pulls high-quality PNG icons directly from Windows EXEs, with advanced BMP reconstruction for maximum compatibility.
